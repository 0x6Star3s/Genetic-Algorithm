# AI Genetic-Algorithm

I would like to introduce to you how AI Genetic-Algorithm can be done in vanilla JS


## Demo


an example of how AI Genetic-Algorithm works

## how works in brief

at the very beginning, we have to enter the A and B coordinates. The whole project consists in creating an algorithm that will try to get from point A to point B


## Caution

the farther a from b is from, it takes a long time to get to b
